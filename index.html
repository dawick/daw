<p>Home sick with COVID.  You can't hide from it.  I actually want to get it, in a way</p>




<h3>BITCOIN</h3>
<p>I was obsessively reading and watching things about Bitcoin and crytocurrency.  Charles Munger/Warren Buffett, Tyler Cowen, Ryan Payne, etc.  I err on the side of thinking this is one huge Ponzi scheme.  I agree with Warren Buffet that what's interesting about crypto is the blockchain technology behind it.  You can imagine JP Morgan adopting blockchain technology to produce their own "JP Coins" or something.  Facebook is working on "Diem".  He also mentions the concept of paper checks.  Checks are a sort of verification service, but the checks in themselves are not worth anything.</p>

<p>The big giveaway is the fact that noone is using bitcoin to buy and sell anything.  Noone is waiting around for people to start using it as currency.  They're waiting around for others to buy more bitcoin.  It is as valuable as we want it to be.  So, as long as we keep hyping it up, the longer we can keep the bubble inflated.  I think bitcoin will die the moment it gets implimented in any serious way.  Because it won't work.  Why replace the U.S. dollar?  I try to imagine a future scenario where a bitcoin price on an item would be competitive.  The consumer would just toggle between the two (or three or infinite) currencies until they hit the cheapest one.  The person with the highest performing super-smart phone or computer would always get the best price.</p>

<p>Here's a decent breakdown of the blockchain technology:</p>

<blockquote cite="https://www.quora.com/How-is-blockchain-technology-similar-to-torrent-technology-How-is-it-different">
<p>Blockchain technology is based on a combination of three concepts that have existed for some time: peer-to-peer technology, cryptography and game theory.</p>

<p><b>P2P technology</b>: torrents use the p2p technology for distribution of information across the nodes. Nodes on the blockchain network communicate via p2p technology and store information about the blockchain locally. Both concepts (blockchain and torrents) donâ€™t need a central server in order to operate.</p>

<p><b>Cryptography</b> ensures that transparency and privacy are achieved. Cryptographic hash functions encrypt individual transactions. Blocks and transactions are cryptographically connected, hence keeping the blockchain immutable. Miners check every transaction happening on the network, so cheating is impossible.</p>

<p><b>Game theory</b>: there is a need of economic incentive in order to participate in the network. Miners would not approve transactions on the blockchain for free. The Bitcoin blockchain pays the miners and this way they stay "motivated".</p>

<p>So let's compare both technologies further.</p>

<p>The blockchain is a distributed ledger, spread across the nodes of the network. Its sole purpose is to keep a record of the transactions which are happening. Think of an accountant having their balance spreadsheet opened and checking all the numbers over and over again. Notice, not every node has to store the whole blockchain, mostly miners and wallet providers need to store it locally. Users can just trust the other nodes and send transactions around.</p>

<p>Torrents do not have a distributed ledger to work with, they are only used to spread any kind of information across the network.</p>

<p>Both technologies serve a different purpose. Blockchain technology is all about preventing double spending or in other words preventing people from copying information. Torrents are all about copying information. More copies ensure that you have more seeders. No information gets lost in a blockchain. That is not the case with torrents, where an old torrent could loose all its seeders and disappear from the network.</p>

</blockquote>


<p>It's kinda like the torrents I used to use back in the day.  You are simultaneously downloading a file from multiple people at the same time, as opposed to downloading off a website.  This is also unlike Soulseek, where you download from one person at a time.  With torrents, you can download the same file from multiple people.  However, BitTorrent is all about copying.  The similarities are the decentralized nature of it all.</p>

<p>Blockchain is a ledger that's constantly being updated.  Miners are the people verifying it - the equivalent of bankers.</p>

<p>This paper, dated 2018, seems to cover much of the good points and concerns.</p>

<blockquote cite="https://kw.wharton.upenn.edu/kwfellows/files/2018/06/2018-08-30-Bitcoin-Student-Series.pdf">
Bitcoin seems to offer an innovative option to citizens disenchanted with the existing monetary system.
The relatively new digital currency offers not only decentralization, but also a limited money supply - all working within an anonymous peer-to-peer, ledger- based transaction system. As such, it skirts concerns around the over-printing of money, privacy, and efficiency. It also implies that, perhaps, a government is not needed for the currency system.</blockquote>



<h3>Technological Problems</h3>
<blockquote>

<p>In most transactions today, the amount of money moved is usually recorded on a ledger that is entrusted to a third party, such as the central bank. In the bitcoin system, the master ledger (or 'blockchain') is theoretically distributed across all users. This act is intended to remove the need for a third party, and to negate the need for trust by having all users own a copy of the master ledger. The idea is that if all users own a copy, no one person can easily get away with tampering with it.</p>

<p>Although this seems like a good idea, the distribution of ledgers poses two problems. First, the ledger gets increasingly bigger as usage rises over time until it becomes unappealing or impractical to download and constantly update. Second, it creates a gross inefficiency in the verification process of the ledgers after transactions. As the number of users increases once bitcoin adoption gains ground, the ledger that everyone is theoretically supposed to download and update becomes more unwieldy. As of July 17, 2017, the bitcoin blockchain size was 125 gigabytes. This massive size poses numerous problems.</p>

<p>First, it is impossible to make these transactions secure by mobile phone, since most phones don't have the capacity to hold 125 GB of data. Instead, a phone user would have to rely on an exchange that constantly updates its ledger and keeps the coins in a specific account. However, exchanges are employed not just by phone users; those with requisite storage on their computers also may open accounts with an exchange simply for convenience.</p>

<p>By concentrating ledgers in a few exchanges for the sake of efficiency and ease of use, security is compromised. If an attack were to happen on a provider of ledgers, then entire records of transactions could be lost. No one would be able to prove who owned what, and large amounts of bitcoins could be stolen.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if everyone were to constantly maintain a ledger the size of 125 GB and growing, it would be a huge waste of storage space. <em>Furthermore, most people do not have the requisite internet speeds, the technological knowhow, or the patience to constantly maintain such a large digital ledger. Instead, they would rather outsource the job to keep things simple.</em> This problem of efficiency/convenience versus security occurs also in the process of verification of transactions.</p>
</blockquote>



<h3>Transactional Problems</h3>
<blockquote>

The basic functions of a currency are the following: It is a store of value, a medium of exchange, and a unit of account. Although bitcoin meets the criteria as a medium of exchange, it fails as a store of value and a unit of account.

<p>Unlike fiat currencies such as the U.S. dollar, bitcoin has proven to be too volatile to make it a reliable vehicle in which to store value over long periods of time. Its price history since its inception in 2009 has seen extreme ups and downs. Events such as cyber attacks or criminal revelations have all played a part in influencing the price of bitcoin, whether for good or ill. In recent years, signs that Wall Street might join the bitcoin party resulted in a peak price of nearly USD $20,000 in December 2017. But scarcely six months later, the price had plummeted by two-thirds.</p>

<p>This is because bitcoin has no inherent worth, nor does it have any government backing. The only reason why people would even consider buying bitcoin is because they believe they can sell it at a higher price in the future. Current buyers are betting that bitcoin might later become widespread. Therefore, bitcoin is in a positive feedback loop. As more buyers come in, they drive the price up, which in turn attracts more buyers, and so on. However, the reverse is also true. A fall of confidence in the currency will only cause more people to sell, leading to a downward cascade.</p>

<p>As of July 2017, bitcoin's market capitalization was USD $35 billion, compared to the U.S. dollar's $64 trillion. In the U.K., total bitcoin value is miniscule compared to the total amount of pound sterling notes in circulation. The Bank of England, having done extensive research on cryptocurrencies, concludes that bitcoin does not pose any immediate threat to existing financial structures.</p>

<p>Bitcoin's second major transactional problem is that it does not truly function as a unit of account. For a currency to be a unit of account, it must be able to measure the real economic value of an item. For example, an apple might be said to be worth USD $1. The item's value is always seen through the prism of fiat currency. However, that's not the case with bitcoin. For example, while some retailers might accept and list prices in bitcoin, their prices fluctuate along with the price movements of bitcoin. As such, bitcoin does not represent the real value of an item. Rather, it is an intermediary between the item and the fiat currency with which it is being exchanged. Indeed, there are few examples of parties actually negotiating a price solely in bitcoins.</p>

</blockquote>

<h3>Regulatory Challenges</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>Bitcoin also faces three regulatory issues: account insurance, taxation, and illegal usage. Each of these problems may be generalized as an issue arising from anonymity. Even though bitcoin in its current state is only a tiny percentage of the U.S. dollar's total market capitalization, it has already managed to cause many problems. One can only imagine what would happen if bitcoin were to become a truly efficient, independent, and widely accepted currency.</p>

<p>Most modern bank accounts are easily linked to their owners. Governments and financial institutions can identify the owners of monetary assets, the amount of funds held as well as the source of the monies. Although this tracking does raise privacy concerns, not only is
it helpful in the event of a system failure or bank run to sort out how much one should be reimbursed in federally insured accounts, it helps authorities sniff out illegal activities such as money laundering and funding of terrorism plots.  </p>

<p>With bitcoin, personal identities are not linked to individual accounts. If one person were to steal another's account credentials and make transactions, there is no easy way to prove ownership and check whether transactions were legal or not. Furthermore, there would be no way to void and refund fraudulent transactions. This lack of identity would only compound problems in the event of an unforeseen catastrophe. Buyers of bitcoin would lose huge amounts of money, and there would be no regulating agency to insure them and find the cause of the breach. This is especially harmful to bitcoin holders who bought the cryptocurrency as an upfront, legal investment.</p>

<p>To be sure, the anonymity that bitcoin offers is an appealing feature to people who don't want to be tracked, including criminals. Some contend that citizens who have nothing to hide should be less concerned when governments can see their information. The argument is that if citizens cannot trust their government, why should they place more trust in a system designed by an unknown person or a group of persons, which cannot be regulated at all? An anonymous system is advantageous only to those who wish for their identities to remain hidden, especially if they commit illegal acts.</p>

</blockquote>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>Bitcoin has a long way to go before it can become viable, efficient, independent, and widely accepted. It has major technological hurdles, and its acceptance in society is currently limited at best. In its present state, the bitcoin system is controlled by a few major mining companies (it is too costly for individuals), traded through a few major platforms (finding other bitcoin users without a meeting place is difficult), and held in wallets provided by various companies (holding your own key and ledger is too inconvenient). <em>Already, the idea of decentralization has fallen apart simply due to humanity's tenancies towards being frugal, social, and free from hassle.</em></p>

<p>Even if bitcoin becomes a viable currency - efficient in power consumption, independently run, and widely accepted - the problems it brings would likely offset any benefits to citizens. The idea that individuals scattered around the world can work to maintain such
a system is simply against human nature. In such a decentralized monetary system, there would exist a state of economic war that pits people against people.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>And this bit:</p>

<blockquote cite="https://www.brookings.edu/opinions/the-brutal-truth-about-bitcoin/">Ironically, rather than truly democratizing finance, some of these innovations may exacerbate inequality. Unequal financial literacy and digital access might result in sophisticated investors garnering the benefits while the less well off, dazzled by new technologies, take on risks they do not fully comprehend. Computer algorithms could worsen entrenched racial and other biases in credit scoring and financial decisions, rather than reducing them. The ubiquity of digital payments could also destroy any remaining vestiges of privacy in our day-to-day lives.</blockquote>

<p>The MacBook will have 3 Thunderbolt ports.  I need to upgrade my cables.  One port will be for the Samsung SSD, the second will be for the MOTU, and the third will be for miscellaneous USB.  I got a converter to hold me over with the USB hub, but I'll probably need something nicer eventually.</p>

<h3>NFTs, Blockchain, Proof-of-everything</h3>
<p>1 PM Spent an hour reading about NFTs and Ethereum: EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine), nodes, gas, "Txns", etc.  This all seems like a complicated mess.  The entire appeal is that it removes third-party verification services and such, but there are weird haggling procedures for "gas prices" on proof-of-concept puzzles and such:</p>

<blockquote>Fortunately, many services, including MetaMask, provide guidance for novice users who can simply select Slow, Average, or Fast to automatically populate a transaction's gas price based on the wallet's internal algorithms.  More advanced users can still choose to set a customized gas price using their own predictive analytics based on information gleaned from recently confirmed blocks.</blockquote>

<p>As far as I can tell, this is just the transaction portion.</p>

<blockquote>Because proof-of-work systems are, by design, computationally cumbersome, participants have expressed mounting concerns over the energy consumption and environmental unfriendliness of cryptocurrencies whose security protocols depend on proof of work... Consensus mechanisms based on proof-of-stake(PoS) protocols are increasingly popular.  In contrast to proof of work, <em>proof of stake</em> requires sufficient stake -- measured by factors such as account balance or account age -- in the system to confirm transactions.</blockquote>

<p>Yet, this hasn't been implimented yet, and defenders are now making excuses and "what-about-isms".  Moreover, this is all insanely complicated and unintuitive.  How this scales into something that's accessable to everyone without a ton of middle-men navigating the whims of "gas prices" and digital wallets seems like a tall order.</p>

<h3>Minecraft</h3>

<p>Some of the most fun I've ever had was playing Minecraft with Eva.  It's definitely more fun playing with her than by myself.  For some reason, the game consumes an insane amount of CPU, and this has taken me down yet another deep rabbit hole.  At the beginning of the pandemic, I tried to refresh my knowledge of Python.  It seemed like Python was installed in 3 different versions, in 3 different locations.  My terminal defaulted to one, the IDLE in another, and Homebrew installed in yet another.  I was pulling my hair out trying to figure this out, and ultimately gave up and swore off Python.</p>

<p>I assume a similar thing is happening with Java.  Maybe Minecraft is compiling on an old version installed in one place rather than another.</p>
<p>Here is some random crap I pulled off the internet:</p>

<p>The best settings for improved FPS are: (circa February 2021)</p>
<ul><li>Fullscreen Resolution: 1920x1080@144</li><li>Biome Blend: OFF</li><li>Graphics: Fast</li><li>Render Distance: 2-6 chunks</li><li>Smooth Lighting: OFF</li><li>Max Framerate: Unlimited</li><li>Use VSync: OFF</li><li>View Bobbing: *</li><li>GUI Scale: *</li><li>Attack Indicator: *</li><li>Brightness: 25%-75%</li><li>Clouds: OFF</li><li>Fullscreen: OFF</li><li>Particles: Minimal</li><li>Minimap Levels: OFF</li><li>Entity Shadows: OFF</li><li>Distortion Effects: *</li><li>Entity Distance: 50%</li><li>FOV Effects: 25%-50%</li></ul>

<p><strong>Optimizations</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Turning down your render distance </li>
<li>Change your graphics setting from 'Fancy' to 'Fast' </li>
<li>Turn off Smooth Lighting and Clouds </li>
<li>Reduce your FOV if it was increased </li>
<li>Set particles to minimal </li>
<li>Turn off vsync (may be dependent on global video card settings) </li>
<li>Disable Mipmaps </li>
<li>Disable Biome Smoothing </li>
<li>Set the game to windowed mode. Similarly, you can also try full screen mode by either toggling in game or pressing 'F11' </li>
<li>When in multiplayer, move away from areas that have many players, mobs, or large buildings </li>
</ul>

<h2>Tuesday, January 4, 2022</h2>
<p>I went out to the space and everything that could possibly go wrong went wrong:  someone was there unscheduled and gave me attitude about it, I forgot my USB cable, the cable for the Softstep didn't work, the midi cable for the iPad was Thunderbolt 4, and I had no backup plan.  Without a USB, I pretty much can't do anything.  This is the sole connection from the outside world to the computer world.  Otherwise I'm just clicking away at the Piano Roll.</p>
<p>This is all to rub in the fact that I have no clue what I'm trying to do musically.  Like with everything else in life, I assume I can chip away at "progress" by just winging it.  Working through a Photoshop tutorial or drum book is not really satisfying without some external feedback.</p>
<p>I could try to continue this journal as a raw website for the limited reason of practicing vim and using HTML and junk.</p>
<p>GitHub is my white whale.  I'm embarrassed to say I don't even know where to begin with this.  GitHub is not a "thing to learn".  It's a means to an end.  I'd rather work a job that gave me real world usage for this.  If I work through a tutorial for the 3rd time, I'll forget everything instantly.</p>

<p>This is a test.  It's kind of a joke to journal in vim and html.  My reasoning is that this would give me more practice getting used to navigating, seeing how I don't have anything to practice on. It might be fun for half a second.  I could always copy and paste it back into Pages.</p>
<p>This could also serve a raw test of how elements work on the page.</p>
<p>Like, how do I space things out? What pattern of spacing? When should I use divs?  Do people even use break tags anymore?  Should I use divs instead?  How efficient is it to write in Vim as opposed to Sublime?  I like Sublime much better because they auto-complete the damn tags.</p>
<p>Each div can be an entry, I suppose.</p>
<h3>Topic #2</h3>
<p>How do I separate different topics?  Also, there's no spell check.  That might be a bummer, but that might also be a reason to learn how to spell. Actually, I might prefer it to the constant auto-correct nonsence.  Another advantage will be the ablity to embed "tags" so I can navigate particular topics like my ramblings on gear and so forth.  Maybe I can experiment with audio clips again.</p>
<p>The more serious limitation is that I can't really edit this from my ipad.  At least not directly.  It doesn't even have a basic text editor (I installed a Vim app for iOS, but predictably I have no clue how it works.  iOS doesn't have a folder structure like a normal computer.  Short of implementing a basic WYSIWYG into the iCloud, for now I'll probably just copy and paste.  We'll see how long this lasts.</p>
<p>
	I've spent all day at the library working on this.  I need to hold myself accountable for what I do and don't do in this new year.  My housemate is yet again giving me the heebie jeebies.  It might be time to get back on the Kewpie and try to make a new friend or something.

<p>Another attempt at a rig, gearing up for a new M1 laptop.  I also need to find nice uses for my current laptop.  Maybe I can use it as a dedicated Max4Live MIDI brain.</p>

<p>I might be coming down with a bit of buyer's remorse for the Organelle M.  I'm really not in the mood to learn PD.  The appeal of this thing is to create a DIY rig that doesn't include a laptop running proprietary things (Ableton/Max/Mainstage).  That takes work, not fun.  Or, it might be the sort of thing where I execute a project I design elsewhere for performance purposes.  I just need to get in the mindset to have fun with this thing.  The portable toy gimmick is the fun.</p>

<p>I'm currently in free fall regarding my work situation.  If I'm not careful, I'll run out of money quickly.  I should preemptively sell anything I don't use, like my pedals and the Roland FA.  It might not be worth repairing the pitch bender.</p>

<p>Going out to the space is still a mess of gear.  I'll drive out there only to sit at the drums for hours.  I need a plan (and no distractions).  If I play drums, I need to set goals.  That David Garibaldi book looks good.  I can work on that for a bit.</p>  

<p>I'm tempted to invest in a new audio interface that I can keep at the space.  I'm tired of having to keep setting it up.  Honestly, I need to learn to live with the Roland FA as an interface until I get a new job.</p>
