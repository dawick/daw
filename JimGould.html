<p>Well there's this whole area of research, this grouping of disciplines called MIR-music information retrieval.</p>

<p>The results of that are those things on your phone where you can ask, "What's that song?" and figure out what it is.
Yeah, so basically that world of research is called MIR. Which is a combination of other disciplines like FFT (Fast Fourier transform) analysis and delta signals and all that shit. As a sort of adjunct to my near-lifelong obsession with Roland Kayn and the idea of music based on cybernetics, I was researching various things about MIR over the past couple years-not because I'm interested in it as a technology, but because of the parts of technology that make it up.</p>

<p>What that album is, and the name's sort of a clue-I'm surprised no one's caught on, it's not that obscure. But basically I made an FFT analysis of-[Glenn Gould]</p>

<p>So I did an FFT analysis of all the Goldberg Variations. But what I did was, for each particular variation, based on the simple ideas of-and they were simple because I was just doing tests-how many modulations and blah blah blah. When you're doing FFT analysis, it's basically like a time domain analysis. Depending on the sample rate you're working at, you're cutting up music into slices of time, almost like plastic overlays. It's kind of like when you see those things when you make slices of the brain and you're putting see-through, plastic pieces on top of each other for each slice.</p>

<p>So with the Fourier transform, you're taking time slices and you're reading the energy levels of the frequencies as sine waves-sinusoidal-for each slice. Then to recreate it, these slices and the sine waves and particular amplitudes are recreated in the same time domain. But what I was doing was changing the time domain as well as resynthesizing it-not with sine waves, but with a wave table of a hundred and fifty different wave forms that were dependent upon both the frequency and the amplitude in regards to something particular about that Goldberg variation.</p>

<p>So I was recreating those performances of the Goldberg Variations with this kind of skewered, nutso, FFT resynthesis. And then what I did (laughs) was once I resynthesized those-which is that kind of crazy, squelchy, noisy part-I ran that through a program which tries to read musical material out of the audio. And that made a new score that was played on the piano.</p>

<p>It actually took a long time to make that-mostly just a lot of programming. It's information taken from Glenn Gould, put through this FFT process, and the results of that FFT process are then searched for pitch information-which has nothing to do with the original. Some didn't work very well but I was taken aback because I actually liked the piano parts a lot (laughs). I didn't touch it at all. The piano parts are literally what the software I wrote read out of these FFT files.</p>
